The file distanceBetweenPoints.py finds out the distance between any 2 points on a horizontal plane in a camera. Refer SampleOuput.jpg
This code was written as part of my research work to track the distance between fingers.

Ensure there is a standard square marker in the camera field of view (like the black square marker of 20 mm X 20 mm in SampleOutput.jpg)

Also, the upper point should be red while the bottom point should be black to track the two points individually and accurately. 

Change the parameter capDeviceNum = 0 according to camera capture number and actualWidth = 20 parameter to set the width of the Standard square in mm.
